# Fozzie Colour Palette

This module allows projects to import the Just Eat brand colour palette, so that they can always stay up to date with any changes made.

Colours are made available by a number of Sass variables that once the module has been imported can be referenced in a projects Sass files.

## Usage

1. The easiest way to use fozzie modules in your Sass setup is to use [Eyeglass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eyeglass).

If you are using the [fozzie gulp build tasks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@justeat/gulp-build-fozzie), then Eyeglass is automatically setup ready to use.  If not, you can use it in one of the following ways:

[Gulp](https://github.com/sass-eyeglass/eyeglass/blob/master/site-src/docs/integrations/gulp.md)
[WebPack](https://github.com/sass-eyeglass/eyeglass/issues/153#issuecomment-300895607)

2.  Install the fozzie-colour-palette module using NPM or Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn add @justeat/fozzie-colour-palette
    ```

3.  Then within your Sass files, you will need to import this module.

    ```scss
    @import 'fozzie-colour-palette';
    ```

You can then use any of the colour variables [contained in the module](https://github.com/justeat/fozzie-colour-palette/blob/master/src/scss/index.scss).

Itâ€™s recommended that you hook onto and use the variable abstractions such as `$color-text` and `$color-link-default` where it makes sense to, rather than directly onto the colour variables.  That way your project will require less re-factoring should the colour palette ever get a major overhaul in the future and certain colours get replaced and/or renamed.
